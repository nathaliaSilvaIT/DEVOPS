# Level 3

Create a private or public repository. Call the repository whatever you like. I'll be calling my repository "dojo". The repository you create will be used moving forward to complete challenges.

1. Configure your local git project with pull and fetch URL's for the remote repository.
2. Ensure that your local git config is globally set to include your username and email
3. Push your work to the remote server
