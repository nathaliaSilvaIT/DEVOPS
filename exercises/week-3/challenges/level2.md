# Level 2
In the scripts directory of the work we completed for level one, we're going to modify the create_exercise shell script to perform the following operations:

1. The script will ask for a number
2. If the input is not a number between 3 and 10, exit the script
3. If the number is between 3 and 10 continue
4. With the number provided, create a directory in the exercises folder called "week-0${number_entered}"
5. Create two folders in the newly created directory. One called challenges, the other called solutions
