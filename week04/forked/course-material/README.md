### How this all works
---
[Exercises](./exercises) contains a list of directories. Each directory contains a weeks worth of lab work, challenges and solutions.

[Scripts](./scripts) contains a script that will generate a new week in the exercise folder. Just execute the script on the command line and it will ask for a number between 3-10. *Do not pre-fix with a 0*.
